# The Return of Immersive Scarecrows

This project is a "fork" of Immersive Scarecrows, a Stardew Valley mod originally from aedenthorn.

Link to the original repo: https://github.com/aedenthorn/StardewValleyMods

The purpose of this fork is, basically, to make it compatible with version 1.6 of SV, which was released on March 19, 2024.
