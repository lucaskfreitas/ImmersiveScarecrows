# The Return of Immersive Scarecrows

This project is a Fork of [Immersive Scarecrows](https://github.com/aedenthorn/StardewValleyMods/tree/master/ImmersiveScarecrows), a Stardew Valley mod originally from aedenthorn.

The purpose of this fork is basically to make it compatible with version 1.6 of SV, which was released on March 19, 2024.

## ï»¿Overview

With this mod you can place scarecrows directly onto tilled soil tiles. Scarecrows will be placed on the corner closest to the mouse cursor and protect crops surrounding it.

Immersive scarecrows can be passed through by the farmer.

To remove a scarecrow, hover over it and press the pickup key (default E).

You can swap the scarecrow at any junction with another by placing it at the same junction.

You can check a scarecrow range by hovering over it and holding down the range check key (default Left Alt).

You can change scarecrow scale, opacity, and position in the config.

## Notes

Scarecrows are stored in the tilled soil object; the mod will prevent the destruction of the tilled soil containing the scarecrow.

Scarecrow radius will be affected by mods that change scarecrow radius or add scarecrow with custom radii. Modded scarecrows with different protection shapes or mechanics will not affect immersive scarecrows.

## Config

You can customize this mod by editing the config file or using [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098).
